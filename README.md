## What is this project for
 - Currently we can use aws cli or website to fetch cloudwatch logs in a given timeframe, but it has a limitation of 10k max logs per query.
 - It becomes really hard to split adjust the timeframes and gather all the logs with guaranteed accuracy
 - This is where <b>cloudwatch-log-aggregator</b> helps. It used a recursive approach to split adjust the timeframes based on the output log count, fetches and writes them to an output log file

## How to use
- Download the latest binary from the [releases section](https://github.com/hemachandsai/cloudwatch-log-aggregator/releases) depending on the target platform
- Create a config.toml file in the same directory as the downloaded binary and fill in the required details. Sample <b>config.toml</b> ðŸ‘‡
```
StartTime = "2019-12-04T00:00:00"
EndTime = "2020-12-15T23:59:59"
LogGroupName = "/aws/lambda/testFunction"
LogQuery = """fields @timestamp, @message
| sort @timestamp desc"""
AWSRegion = "us-east-1"
```
- Execute the download binary with desired flags
```
usage: ./cloudwatch-log-aggregator [<flags>]

A CLI tool to fetch all cloudwatch logs within given timeframe

Flags:
  -h, --help           Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and
                       --help-man).
  -c, --concurrency=4  Max concurrent calls to aws (Default value: 4) Min: 1
                       Max: 9
      --debug          Enable debug mode
```

## Examples
```
cloudwatch-log-aggregator-windows.exe
cloudwatch-log-aggregator-windows.exe -c 6
./cloudwatch-log-aggregator-linux -c 5
./cloudwatch-log-aggregator-darwin --concurrency=5
```
 
## Requirements 
Requires a system with total memory greater than 2GB.

## How to contribute
Feel free to raise a PR with new features or fixing existing bugs

## Future plans
- Currently all the logs are stored and read from memory which is not suitable for bulk queries. Planning to convert it into a disk storage.
